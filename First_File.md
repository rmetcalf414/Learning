# This is my First File
To achieve the understanding of GitHub, I am creating my first file.
I have placed this file in the GitHub/Learning folder. Once saved, I'm hoping it will show up in my list. Then, I will commit this file so that I can view it from the browser...I hope!
```
Just some code block
